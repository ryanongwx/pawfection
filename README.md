# Motivation

I am a frequent volunteer at an animal welfare shelter. Six months ago, I was following my usual routine at the shelter, and was about to bring Grunt, my favourite dog, on his mandatory routine walk. After putting on his leash, he sat there staring at me and was reluctant to move at all! I was later informed that another volunteer had just taken him for a walk 30 minutes ago.

Existing systems that have been employed within animal welfare shelters consist of many **fragmented processes.** Videos on how to apply treatment on animals are stored on Google Drive and specific information about each pet is listed extensively within spreadsheets. Additionally, coordination between volunteers and managers are done through different direct/group text messages on Telegram. A lapse like what I had encountered was a benign one but imagine the impact of more significant lapses eg. an overdose in medication administered.
